# ExcellentEngine

Just another Engine for me to test and learn from by adding new features and whatever nothing really over the top.

To build just go in the root and activate the cmd. Type in "vendor\premake\premake5.exe <platform-here>" and you are all done.

Be warned this only for Windows right now.
